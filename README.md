codingcatgirl built an indoor router planner tool for the 32nd Chaos
Communication Congress that is available at https://c3nav.de

This app is a simple wrapper for the c3nav website that adds the
possibility to automatically determine your current position
based on Wifi signals.

You can get the app on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.c3nav.droid),
on [GitHub](https://github.com/raphaelm/c3nav-android/releases) and on F-Droid (soon).
